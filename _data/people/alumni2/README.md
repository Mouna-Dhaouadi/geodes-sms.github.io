# Status
* There are people (about 30) in the old site's alumni list that are not found yet in the above sources. They might be pre-Papyrus people.
* There are poeple (about 20) we found on Papyrus supervised by former professors, but it's unclear if those students were indeed supervised during the GEODES-time of the specific professor. Check with Houari.
* `professors.yml` - Should be cross-checked with Houari.
* `postdocs.yml` - Should be cross-checked with the profs. They should include their own archives.
