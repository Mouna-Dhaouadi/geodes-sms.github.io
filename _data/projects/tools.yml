  description: lowkey is a low-level and transparent framework for real-time collaborative framework for multi-level and multi-view modeling. At the bottom layer of the architecture of lowkey, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) take care of preventing inconsistencies before they happen. The physical metamodel built on top of these data types allows for defining arbitrary numbers of linguistic models, which are in a type-instance relationship with each other. The framework is available as a Python implementation.
