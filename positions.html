    <!-- Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO) -->
    <!-- The GEODES Software Engineering research group (geodes.iro.umontreal.ca) -->

    We have <strong>2 fully funded PhD positions available for research in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE)</strong>.
    The research projects are related to the application of MDSE principles, methodologies, technologies, and abstractions to the AI domain and vice versa. <br>
    Successful applicants will work with professors <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/">Houari Sahraoui</a> and <a href="https://michalis.famelis.info/">Michalis Famelis</a>,
    as well as the other members of the GEODES group. They will conduct research under the supervision of the principal investigators and hence will be involved in every step of the project and have the opportunity to work with a team of graduate students. 
    They are expected to participate in the writing and publication of scientific papers and the implementation of research prototypes.
