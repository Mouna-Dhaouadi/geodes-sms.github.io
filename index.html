GEODES is the software engineering group of the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca">University of Montreal, Canada</a>,
as part of the <a href="https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home">Department of Computer Science and Operational Research
    (DIRO)</a>.<br /><br />
<!-- There are {{ mscs.size }} master's students, {{ phds.size }} doctoral students, and {{ postdocs.size }} post-doctoral fellows affiliated with the group currently. -->

<i>TODO: research areas, focus. (Normally, a mission statement would come here.)</i> <br /><br />

    Since 1992, more than thirty students have obtained a PhD degree from the group, and more then a hundred students
    have graduated with a Master's degree. Many of these students are professors in Quebec, Canada, and around the world
    (Ã‰TS, Laval, Polytechnique, UQAM, Ottawa, DePaul, Houston, Indiana, Michigan, United Arab Emirates, etc.), and
    others hold key positions at large tech companies.<br />
    The group has developed strong connections with local SMEs and large industrial groups, giving rise to frequent
    collaborations and projects.<br />
    We are active members of our extended scientific community. Recently, we have organized the 23rd edition of the <a
        href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2020">ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering
        Languages and Systems (MODELS)</a>.
