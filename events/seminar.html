<br/>
The GEODES Seminar aims to bring together members of the group in a semi-formal setting with a semi-regular timing.<br/><br/>

We'd especially love to see students at all levels reporting their progress, entertain presentations on core or adjacent topics, host dry-runs before conferences, etc.
These events follow an <b>in-person</b> format. By that, we hope to re-establish the everyday social aspects of the research group in a post-COVID world.<br/><br/>

<b>Format</b>: In person<br/>
<b>Location</b>: Pavillon André-Aisenstadt<br/><br/>
