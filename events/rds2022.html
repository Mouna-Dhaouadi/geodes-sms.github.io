Welcome to the 2022 edition of the GEODES Research Day and Symposium. This event aims to bring together current and former members of GEODES to exchange research results, ideas and plans, as well as reflecting on the previous year and preparing for the year ahead.<br/><br/>

<h3>Motivation and goals</h3>

The Research Day serves multiple purposes.<br/>
The series of presentations allows for a hands-on assessment of the balance between the <a href="/about">focus areas</a> of the group. <i>Professors</i> and <i>postdocs</i> might want to leverage this opportunity for roadmapping exercises and setting tangible goals for the forthcoming year.<br/>
The event provides <i>graduate students</i> with an excellent opportunity to hone their presentation skills and to get ready for larger venues (workshops, conferences). This is especially important as life gets back to normal after COVID-19, and scientific events will switch to in-person formats (at least partially).
<br/><br/>

<h3>Coordinates</h3>
Date: <b>January 21 (Friday), 2022</b>.<br/>
Location: <b>Campus MIL</b>. (Details TBA in January.)<br/><br/>

This is an in-person event. Should you be unable to attend in person, please, indicate this clearly upon submitting your abstract. (See below.)
<br/><br/>

Although these materials will not be presented during the Research Day, they will be published on the website.<br/><br/>
