Welcome to the 2022 edition of the GEODES Research Day and Symposium. This event aims to bring together current and former members of GEODES to exchange research results, ideas and plans, as well as reflecting on the previous year and preparing for the year ahead.<br/><br/>

<h3>Motivation and goals</h3>

The Research Day serves multiple purposes.<br/>
The series of presentations allows for a hands-on assessment of the balance between the <a href="/about">focus areas</a> of the group. <i>Professors</i> and <i>postdocs</i> might want to leverage this opportunity for roadmapping exercises and setting tangible goals for the forthcoming year.<br/>
The event provides <i>graduate students</i> with an excellent opportunity to hone their presentation skills and to get ready for larger venues (workshops, conferences). This is especially important as life gets back to normal after COVID-19, and scientific events will switch to in-person formats (at least partially).
<br/><br/>

<h3>Coordinates</h3>
Date: <b>January 21 (Friday), 2022</b>. <span style="color:red;font-weight:750;">(To be confirmed in December.)</span><br/>

<h3>Content</h3>
<b>Graduate students, doctoral students and postdocs</b> are invited to give a talk of the following three types.
<ul>
    <li>Flash talks (5 minutes talk + 5 minutes discussion)</li>
    <li>Technical presentations (10 + 5)</li>
    <li>Demos (10 + 5)</li>
</ul>

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>research and/or development results;</li>
    <li>reflections and lessons learned;</li>
    <li>future plans, roadmaps;</li>
    <li>novel topics, overviews, aggregated knowledge outside of the (current) scope of the group that have the potential to improve and contribute to the body-of-knowledge of the group.</li>
</ul>

<b>Professors</b> are invited to give a keynote talk of 15-20 minutes at the beginning of the thematic tracks. This is an excellent opportunity to introduce the remainder of the track as a big picture, by connecting topics and people within a larger scope.<br/>
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>reflections on the previous year;</li>
    <li>future plans, roadmaps;</li>

<h3>Publication</h3>

After the event, we will publish the materials on the GEODES website (unless explicitly asked not to). Therefore, we encourage everyone to prepare conference-quality content. Digital supplementary materials, such as videos and replication packages are welcome. Although these materials will not be presented during the Research Day, they will be published on the website.<br/><br/>
